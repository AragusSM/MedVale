echinocandins,Echinocandins,"caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the synthesis of β-glucan in the fungal cell wall via noncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme 1,3-β glucan synthase. The class has been dubbed the ""penicillin of antifungals,"" along with the related papulacandins, as their mechanism of action resembles that of penicillin in bacteria",Antifungal,"[""inhibit beta 13 glucan synthesis, crippling fungal cell wall"", ""rare GI side effects but generally well tolerated""]",echinocandin.png
